# Fix GitHub Issue

Implement an entire GitHub issue based on its implementation plan.

## Usage

```
/ke:fix [issue-number]
```

Issue number is optional if an issue has already been discussed in the current conversation.

## Instructions

You are tasked with fully implementing a GitHub issue based on its implementation plan.

### Step 0: Determine the Issue Number(s)

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided and non-empty, parse it for issue numbers
  - Multiple issue numbers can be provided (e.g., `42 43 44` or `42, 43, 44` or `#42 #43`)
  - Extract all numeric issue identifiers from the arguments
- Otherwise, infer the issue number using these sources (in priority order):
  1. Conversation context (previously discussed issue, URL mentioned, `gh issue view` output)
  2. Current branch name (e.g., `issue-42` or `fix-42` suggests issue #42)
  3. Recent commits referencing issues (e.g., `Fix #42` in commit messages)
  4. Open issues assigned to the current user (`gh issue list --assignee @me`)
  5. Recently updated open issues (`gh issue list --state open --limit 5`)
- If no issue number is provided, make your best guess based on the above sources, then **ask the user to confirm** before proceeding:
  ```
  No issue number provided. Based on [source], I believe you want to work on:
  - #42: [Issue title]

  Is this correct? (yes/no/specify different issue)
  ```

**If multiple issue numbers are provided:**
- Process each issue sequentially (complete all steps for issue 1, then all steps for issue 2, etc.)
- Track the outcome of each issue (success, failure, skipped, etc.)
- After processing ALL issues, provide a summary report (see "Final Summary Report" section at the end)

### Step 1: Fetch the Issue and Plan

Use `gh issue view <issue-number> --comments` to read the issue and find the implementation plan comment.

### Step 2: Implement the Solution

**CRITICAL: Before writing any code, identify ALL phases in the implementation plan.**

Implementation plans often have multiple phases (e.g., "Phase 1: Backend", "Phase 2: Frontend", "Phase 3: Tests"). You MUST complete ALL phases, not just the first one.

**2a. Parse the plan and list all phases:**
- Read through the entire implementation plan
- Identify each phase/section (look for "Phase 1", "Step 1", numbered sections, or logical groupings)
- Announce what you found: "This plan has X phases: [list them]"

**2b. Implement each phase sequentially:**
- Work through each phase in order
- After completing each phase, explicitly state: "Phase X complete. Moving to Phase Y..."
- Do NOT stop after one phase unless the user interrupts

**2c. Make the code changes:**
- Make all necessary code changes
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Keep changes focused on what the plan specifies

### Step 3: Update the Issue

Post a completion comment on the issue using `gh issue comment`:

```markdown
## Implementation Complete

### Phases Completed
- [x] Phase 1: [name] - [brief summary]
- [x] Phase 2: [name] - [brief summary]
- [x] Phase 3: [name] - [brief summary]

### Changes Made
- `path/to/file.ts` - [brief description of change]
- `path/to/other.ts` - [brief description of change]

### Notes
[Any relevant notes about the implementation, decisions made, or things to watch for]

**If you cannot complete all phases**, you MUST inform the user what remains:

```markdown
## Implementation Partially Complete

### Phases Completed
- [x] Phase 1: [name] - [brief summary]
- [ ] Phase 2: [name] - NOT STARTED
- [ ] Phase 3: [name] - NOT STARTED

### Remaining Work
[Explain what phases remain and why you stopped]

### Changes Made So Far
- `path/to/file.ts` - [brief description of change]
```

### Step 4: Ask for Review

After updating the issue, ask the user to review the changes before committing.

### Important

- Do NOT commit any changes
- Do NOT push any changes
- **Implement ALL phases from the plan** - do not stop after completing just one phase
- **Announce progress** - state which phase you're working on and when each completes
- **If stopping early**, clearly report what phases remain incomplete
- Always ask the user to review before finishing
- If the plan is missing or unclear, ask for clarification before implementing

### Final Summary Report (for multiple issues)

When multiple issues were processed, provide a summary table at the end:

```markdown
## Issues Processed

| Issue | Title | Status | Files Changed |
|-------|-------|--------|---------------|
| #42 | [Issue title] | ✅ Implemented | 3 files |
| #43 | [Issue title] | ✅ Implemented | 5 files |
| #44 | [Issue title] | ❌ Failed | No plan found |
| #45 | [Issue title] | ⏭️ Skipped | Already resolved |

### Summary
- **Implemented:** 2
- **Failed:** 1
- **Skipped:** 1
```
