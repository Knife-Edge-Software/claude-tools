# Plan GitHub Issue

Review a GitHub issue and create an implementation plan, then post it as a comment on the issue.

## Usage

```
/ke:plan [issue-number]
```

Issue number is optional if an issue has already been discussed in the current conversation.

## Instructions

You are tasked with reviewing a GitHub issue and creating a detailed implementation plan. Do NOT implement any code changes - only create the plan.

### Step 0: Determine the Issue Number(s)

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided and non-empty, parse it for issue numbers
  - Multiple issue numbers can be provided (e.g., `42 43 44` or `42, 43, 44` or `#42 #43`)
  - Extract all numeric issue identifiers from the arguments
- Otherwise, check conversation context for an obvious issue (previously discussed issue, URL mentioned, `gh issue view` output)
- If no issue number is provided and nothing obvious in context:
  1. Fetch open issues that have no comments (likely unplanned): `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,createdAt,labels --limit 50`
  2. Filter to issues with 0 comments (check each with `gh issue view <number> --json comments`)
  3. Present the top 10 unplanned issues to the user:
  ```
  No issue number provided. Here are open issues without implementation plans:

  | # | Issue | Title | Labels | Created |
  |---|-------|-------|--------|---------|
  | 1 | #42 | Add dark mode | enhancement | 2 days ago |
  | 2 | #41 | Fix login bug | bug | 3 days ago |
  | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

  Which issue(s) would you like to plan? (enter number(s), e.g., "1" or "1 3 5")
  ```
  4. Wait for user response before proceeding

**If multiple issue numbers are provided:**
- Process each issue sequentially (complete all steps for issue 1, then all steps for issue 2, etc.)
- Track the outcome of each issue (success, failure, skipped, etc.)
- After processing ALL issues, provide a summary report (see "Final Summary Report" section at the end)

### Step 1: Fetch the Issue

Use `gh issue view <issue-number> --comments` to read the issue details including title, body, labels, and any existing comments.

### Step 1a: Check for Existing Plan

Look through the issue comments for an existing implementation plan (comments containing "## Implementation Plan" or similar headers).

**If a plan already exists:**

1. Display the existing plan to the user (or a summary if it's long)
2. Ask the user how to proceed:

```
This issue already has an implementation plan (posted [date] by [author]):

---
[Show first ~20 lines of the plan or summary]
---

How would you like to proceed?
1. **Skip** - Keep existing plan, don't create a new one
2. **Update** - Refine/add to the existing plan
3. **Replace** - Discard existing plan and create a new one from scratch
```

3. Based on user response:
   - **Skip**: Report "Skipped - existing plan retained" and move to next issue (if batch)
   - **Update**: Proceed to Step 2, but in Step 4 post a comment that builds on/refines the existing plan (reference what changed)
   - **Replace**: Proceed to Step 2, create fresh plan (optionally note "Replaces previous plan" in the comment)

**If no plan exists:**
- Continue to Step 2

### Step 2: Analyze the Codebase

Based on the issue requirements:
- Identify which files would need to be modified or created
- Understand the existing patterns and architecture relevant to the issue
- Consider dependencies and potential impacts

Use the Explore agent or search tools to thoroughly understand the codebase context.

### Step 3: Create the Plan

Create a comprehensive implementation plan that includes:

1. **Summary** - Brief overview of what the issue requires
2. **Files to Modify** - List each file with a brief description of what changes are needed
3. **Implementation Steps** - Ordered list of concrete steps to implement the solution
4. **Risks & Considerations** - Potential issues, edge cases, or decisions that need clarification

### Step 4: Post the Plan

Post the plan as a comment on the issue using `gh issue comment`. Format the comment in markdown with clear sections.

Use this template for the comment:

```markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Summary
[Brief overview]

### Files to Modify
- `path/to/file.ts` - [what changes]
- `path/to/other.ts` - [what changes]

### Implementation Steps
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Continue as needed]

### Risks & Considerations
- [Risk or consideration 1]
- [Risk or consideration 2]

### Step 5: Handle Large Issues

If the implementation plan is too large or complex for Claude's context window to handle in a single pass:

1. **Break down into sub-issues** - Create smaller, focused sub-issues using `gh issue create`
2. **Establish dependencies** - Note which sub-issues depend on others being completed first
3. **Update the parent issue** - Add a comment to the original issue explaining the breakdown and linking to sub-issues
4. **Close or keep open** - Keep the parent issue open as a tracking issue, or close it if sub-issues fully replace it

### Step 6: Report Changes

After completing the planning process, provide a summary of all issues changed or created.

If more than one issue was involved (created or modified), respond with a summary table:

| Issue | Title | Dependencies |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| #123 | [Title of issue] | None (parent issue) |
| #124 | [Title of sub-issue 1] | None |
| #125 | [Title of sub-issue 2] | #124 |

Include:
- The original issue (if modified)
- Any new sub-issues created
- Dependencies between issues (which issues must be completed before others)

### Important

- Do NOT make any code changes
- Do NOT create or modify any files other than posting GitHub comments and creating sub-issues
- If the issue is unclear, note what clarifications are needed in the Risks & Considerations section
- If the issue appears to already be resolved or is invalid, note this in your comment instead of a full plan
- When creating sub-issues, use labels and milestones consistent with the parent issue

### Final Summary Report (for multiple issues)

When multiple issues were processed, provide a summary table at the end:

```markdown
## Issues Processed

| Issue | Title | Status | Sub-issues Created |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| #42 | [Issue title] | ✅ Planned | None |
| #43 | [Issue title] | ✅ Planned | #46, #47 |
| #44 | [Issue title] | ❌ Failed | Could not access |
| #45 | [Issue title] | ⏭️ Skipped | Already has plan |

### Summary
- **Planned:** 2
- **Failed:** 1
- **Skipped:** 1
```
